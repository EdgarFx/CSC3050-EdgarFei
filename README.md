# CUHKSZ-CSC3050-Computer Architecture
cuhksz csc3050 computer architecture projects

Record the project I have done. It would be great if it can help the students in need (remember not to copy directly, personally suggest that if you have no ideas, you can look at the code here to find ideas, and then try to write it in your own way).

* project1：Implement mips assembler using c++.
* project2：Implement mips simulator using c++.
* project3：Implementing ALU using verilog.
* project4：Implement pipeline-based CPU using verilog and deal with some hazard.

My four project scores are 100/100, 100/100, 100/100, and 104/100+20 respectively.
